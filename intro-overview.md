# Overview

The Design Online API has been designed around REST. It's main goal is to allow people to easily create surveys from anywhere (for example from a custom survey builder) but you can use the API to automate the scripting process as well.

This API accepts JSON request bodies and returns JSON objects and authentification is a requirement to calling endpoints.
