# Overview

The Design Online API has been designed around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) principles. The main goal is to allow users to easily create and modify surveys from any environment that consumes the API (for example, from a custom survey builder) but users can also use the API to automate the scripting process.

The API accepts [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)-formatted request bodies and returns JSON-formatted responses. Authentification is required for all endpoints.
